 # Star-War-planet

 Description:

This task involves building a web application that serves as a directory for planets within the Star Wars universe. Users should be able to view essential information about each planet, including details like climate, population, and terrain. Additionally, the application should display a list of residents for each planet, showcasing their individual characteristics like name, height, mass, and gender.

Back to Home:

When users are viewing details about a specific planet, provide a "Back to Home" button or link that allows them to return to the home page, where the list of planets is displayed.

Load More :

When the application loads, fetch the initial set of planets from the SWAPI endpoint (https://swapi.dev/api/planets/?format=json) and display them on the page.
Implement a mechanism to handle pagination. The SWAPI response includes a next field, which contains the URL for the next page of planets. When users click on a "Load More" button, fetch the  planets using this URL.
